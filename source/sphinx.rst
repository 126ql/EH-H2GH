About Sphinx
=============

Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create documentation.
It was designed (and is used) for the python documentation, but can be used to document projects in several other languages. It can also be used (like in the H^2GH) to document non programming projects

Sphinx uses 
`Restructured Text (RST) <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_
as a markup language.  
This guide is intended to give a basic introduction to RST and the use of sphinx
